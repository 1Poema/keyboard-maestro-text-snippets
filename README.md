# Character and little string snippets for Keyboard Maestro

## Why use these snippets?
If you use Keyboard Maestro, you are using MacOS, so you could do what these snippets do with System Preferences like [this](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-best-way-to-type-__/371351/).

But by just using the System Preferences you:
* have to hit the spacebar after your string, even if that’s not what you want
* can’t set your snippets only for certain applications or contexts.
